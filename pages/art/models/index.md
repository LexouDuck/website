### Lowpoly Models

![](assets/models/monocarrier.gif){height="500"}

This model was made with heavy inspiration from [Kenneth
Fejer](http://kennethfejer.com/3d.html)\'s lowpoly modeling style. The
design of this spaceship is a throwback to Faye\'s gunship from the
anime Cowboy Bebop.

This model was made with an interesting program called
[Crocotile3D](http://www.crocotile3d.com/), which is a 3D DCC program
with a tile-based workflow. The textures are these very cool GBC-style
dark souls sprites made by [Ryumaru over at the Pixelation
forums](https://pixelation.org/index.php?topic=17902.0).

### Lowpoly Models - Nuclear Throne

This set of models was a for-fun project of mine to remake the popular
roguelike indie game Nuclear Throne, with lowpoly 3D assets rather than
2D sprites.
