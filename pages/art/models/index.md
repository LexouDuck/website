Here are some of the 3D models I have made over the years.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Lowpoly Models

This model was made with heavy inspiration from [Kenneth Fejer](http://kennethfejer.com/3d.html)'s lowpoly modeling style.
The design of this spaceship is a throwback to *Faye Valentine*'s gunship from the popular anime *Cowboy Bebop*.

##### Crocotile3D

This model was made with an interesting program called [Crocotile3D](http://www.crocotile3d.com/),
which is a 3D modeling program, with a special tile-based workflow, thought out for lowpoly-pixelart-style games.
The textures are these very cool *Gameboy Color* style sprites of *Dark Souls* made by
[Ryumaru, over at the Pixelation forums](https://pixelation.org/index.php?topic=17902.0).

##### Nuclear Throne

This set of models was a for-fun project of mine to remake the popular
roguelike indie game [*Nuclear Throne*](#), with lowpoly 3D assets rather than 2D sprites.

### Mid/Highpoly Models

This is the character Tang Rou, from *The King's Avatar* (a.k.a. 全职高手 or *Quán zhí Gāo shǒu*).
This was made to participate in a game project, where the objective was to re-create
the MMO game *Glory*, which is the central focus of this story.
The game was being built using *Unreal Engine* - though as you can imagine,
the scope of a game like *Glory* is probably much too large for a fan labor of love.
Unfortunately, it seems that the project has been abandoned...
The extent of my participation was really just to make this model:
