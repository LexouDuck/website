# 3D Models

Here are some of the 3D models I have made over the years.

I have interested in 3D modeling since I was a child playing video games,
in particular lowpoly models of old consoles, particularly the "PS1" or "DS" style
of models, that use unfiltered pixelart textures.

At first I experimented a little bit with [Google Sketchup](https://www.sketchup.com/),
then got the opportunity to use [3DS max](https://www.autodesk.com/products/3ds-max/overview),
until I settled on [Maya](https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview) for a while,
since it is highly customizable and scriptable. Though, more recently, I have
begun to take a liking to [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) (and not just because of *AutoDe$k*'s pricing!) -
its user interface has made great progress since the early days when I first tried it.

### Lowpoly Models

This model was made with heavy inspiration from [Kenneth Fejer](http://kennethfejer.com/3d.html)'s lowpoly modeling style.
The design of this spaceship is a throwback to *Faye Valentine*'s gunship from the popular anime *Cowboy Bebop*.

Unfortunately, this model uses a 48x48 texture - since the size is not a power of two, sketchfab compresses/botches the texture… Here’s a GIF with a proper texture, at an appropriately small resolution:

##### Crocotile3D

![](darksouls.png)

This model was made with an interesting program called [Crocotile3D](http://www.crocotile3d.com/),
which is a 3D modeling program, with a special tile-based workflow, thought out for lowpoly-pixelart-style games.
The textures are these very cool *Gameboy Color* style sprites of *Dark Souls* made by
[Ryumaru, over at the Pixelation forums](https://pixelation.org/index.php?topic=17902.0).

##### Nuclear Throne

This set of models was a for-fun project of mine to remake the popular
roguelike indie game [*Nuclear Throne*](http://nuclearthrone.com/), with lowpoly 3D assets rather than 2D sprites.

### Mid/Highpoly Models

This is the character Tang Rou, from *The King's Avatar* (a.k.a. 全职高手 or *Quán zhí Gāo shǒu*).
This was made to participate in a game project, where the objective was to re-create
the MMO game *Glory*, which is the central focus of this story.
The game was being built using *Unreal Engine* - though as you can imagine,
the scope of a game like *Glory* is probably much too large for a fan labor of love.
Unfortunately, it seems that the project has been abandoned...
The extent of my participation was really just to make this model:
