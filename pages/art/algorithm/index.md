These are images which I generated by implementing various algorithms - mathematical art, as some call it.

I am quite fascinated with both mathematics and programming, as well as art.
It only makes sense that I would try to tap into the innate beauty of geometry.

### Custom rendered fractals

Here is a zoom-out of a very interesting [complex fractal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal#:~:text=Escape-time%20fractals), known as the [*burning ship fractal*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_Ship_fractal), drawn here with an escape-time algorithm.

I was also later glad to find out that this particular animated image ended up being the Wikimedia foundation's [media of the day](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Burning_Ship_Fractal_Zoom-out_64.gif) image for 16 May 2020.

Here is a small animation of zooming within a Mandelbrot fractal, to find a self-similar shape:

All of these images were made using my own program, which was done as part of the "fractol" project for the 42 school. You can find the code for this project on [my github](https://github.com/LexouDuck/42/tree/master/06-fractol).

Finally here is an animation which shows off the randomized color palette generation feature of this custom fractal display program:

### With Processing

These images were done with the Processing desktop app, written in Java, around 2016.
