<h1 id="pixel-art">Pixel Art</h1>
<p>These are some of the pixel art works I’ve made over the years.</p>
<p>Since I was very young, I have been drawing - and have been fascinated with video game sprites and backgrounds. I naturally spent quite some time getting better at making pixelart, hanging on PixelJoint and the Spriters’ Resource forums.</p>
<p>Pretty much all of these were made entirely in mspaint - though I have been using other tools here and there, like <a href="https://www.coranac.com/projects/usenti/">usenti</a> and <a href="https://graphicsgale.com/us/">GraphicGale</a>, and more recently <a href="https://www.aseprite.org/">aseprite</a>.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="original-pieces">Original Pieces</h3>
<p>This was done for on contest on <a href="https://pixeljoint.com/pixelart/96147.htm">Pixeljoint</a>, constraints being a very limited 8-color palette (6 colors plus black and white) and a predetermined canvas size.</p>
<p><img src="gambit.png" /></p>
<p>This one is purely monochromatic (black/white), I made this to experiment with pixel dithering patterns.</p>
<p><img src="sunset.png" /></p>
<p>This one is a rather simple sprite I had at my beginnings, back in 2012.</p>
<p><img src="roboto.png" /></p>
<p>This is one of the first characters I ever designed, originally for a sprite constest on <a href="https://www.vg-resource.com/thread-13273-page-2.html">the Spriters’ Resource</a>, way back in 2010.</p>

<h3 id="demake-mockups">Demake Mockups</h3>
<p>These are some NES-style “demake” mockups, that I made to illustrate some of my <a href="/pages/music/chiptunes/index.html">chiptune covers</a>.</p>
<p><img src="demake-starfox.png" /></p>
<p><img src="demake-ff4.png" /></p>
<p><img src="demake-ff7.png" /></p>
<p>This piece was an experiment, to attempt to show how it might be possible to have some background graphics displayed on the original Gameboy <em>Pokemon</em> games.</p>
<p><img src="pokemon-critique.png" /></p>

<h3 id="fanart">Fanart</h3>
<p>Here are a couple sprites done in the style of the Gameboy Advance <em>Fire Emblem</em> games. I have always been a big fan of these games, as you can tell from my <a href="/pages/tools/emblem_magic/index.html">Emblem Magic</a> project.</p>
<p><img src="fire-emblem_balrog.gif" /></p>
<p><img src="fire-emblem_marth.png" /></p>
<p>I was also always a big fan of the <em>Paper Mario</em> games, and so I created a couple of sprites edits, mostly to reproduce characters from <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em> in the style of the original <em>Paper Mario</em> on the Nintendo 64.</p>
<p><img src="paper-mario-64_doopliss.png" /></p>

<h3 id="the-fighters-resource">The Fighters’ Resource</h3>
<p>This was a pretty cool community game project on <a href="https://www.vg-resource.com/thread-20507.html">the Spriters’ Resource forums</a>. Many of the regular users there had a “character reference”, a mascot/avatar character to represent themselves. Since most all of the users on the forum were big pixelart enthusiasts, a good friend of mine, <a href="https://twitter.com/spritergors">Gorsal</a> made a full character sprite sheet for his own “ref” mascot, in a pretty simple style, along with pretty extensive style guides for others to make their own “ref” mascot sprite sheets. You can download a playable build of the game <a href="https://www.vg-resource.com/thread-25022.html">here</a></p>
<p>Unfortunately, I had never finished the spritesheet for my own character, only basic idle and movement animations: - idle: <img src="TFR_idle.gif" /> - move forwards: <img src="TFR_walk-forward.gif" /> - move backwards: <img src="TFR_walk-backward.gif" /></p>
<p>This strange sprite was made to serve as a “character select” portait. The idea for <em>The Fighters’ Resource</em> was to poke fun at the age-old tradition of most arcade fighting games, which is to have overly detailed character portraits, that are often quite different from how the character actually looks in-game. Here this idea was turned all the way up to eleven, by requiring that each of our “character select” portraits be done in a style reminiscent of <em>JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure</em>.</p>

<h3 id="tsrpg">TSRPG</h3>
<p>Another cool community game project on <a href="https://www.vg-resource.com/thread-23022.html">the Spriters’ Resource forums</a>. This time instead of a fighting game using the characters/mascots of the forum’s users, the goal here was to make a silly JRPG game about the wonderful wacky world of the Spriters’s Resource forums.</p>
<p><img src="TSRPG.png" /></p>
<p>The rightmost sprite here is the humanoid version of my mascot character, and was done by <a href="https://www.vg-resource.com/user-18076.html">VirtuaBoy123</a> to be one of the enemies for the game. I decided to chip in &amp; help out by creating the leftmost sprite - the mantaray version of my mascot. Seeing the two side-by-side, made me want to imagine a mid-level between the two, similar to a <em>Pokemon</em> evolution line - this is why I also created the larger darker manta ray in the middle.</p>

<h3 id="upscaledrevamped-nes-sprites">Upscaled/revamped NES sprites</h3>
<p>This is some of the first “custom” pixelart I had ever done, way back in 2010: This was an old short-lived <a href="NES-revamp_Samus.png">trend</a> on <a href="https://www.vg-resource.com/thread-17156.html">the Spriters’ Resource forums</a>, wherein you take an old-school NES sprite, scale up its size times four, and choose 3 new colors to add to it.</p>
<p>A good friend of mine, <a href="https://pixeljoint.com/p/14966.htm">Chris2balls</a>, had made several of these: <a href="https://pixeljoint.com/pixelart/101853.htm">Ice Climber</a>, <a href="https://pixeljoint.com/pixelart/101855.htm">Balloon Fight</a>, <a href="https://pixeljoint.com/pixelart/101854.htm">Getsu Fuuma</a></p>
<p>And finally, here are the 2 (unfinished) ones that I made, though they pale in comparison to the previous examples…</p>
