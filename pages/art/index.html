<h1 id="artwork">Artwork</h1>
<p>Here is a selection of some of my visual arts works, in various
mediums.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="software-art">Software Art</h1>
<p>These are images which I generated by implementing various algorithms
- mathematical art, as some call it.</p>
<p>I am quite fascinated with both mathematics and programming, as well
as art. It only makes sense that I would try to tap into the innate
beauty of geometry.</p>

<h1 id="color-art">Color Art</h1>
<p>It is rather rare that I actually finish a sketch and decide to give
it some color, but here are some of the few such “finished” works I have
made.</p>
<p>These are mostly digital art for now, I ought to get my on-paper
works scanned and displayed here.</p>

<h1 id="d-models">3D Models</h1>
<p>Here are some of the 3D models I have made over the years.</p>
<p>I have interested in 3D modeling since I was a child playing video
games, in particular lowpoly models of old consoles, particularly the
“PS1” or “DS” style of models, that use unfiltered pixelart
textures.</p>
<p>At first I experimented a little bit with <a href="#">Google
Sketchup</a>, then got the opportunity to use <a href="#">3DS max</a>,
until I settled on <a href="#">Maya</a> for a while, since it is highly
customizable and scriptable. Though, more recently, I have begun to take
a liking to <a href="#">Blender</a> (and not just because of AutoDe$k’s
pricing!).</p>

<h1 id="pixel-art">Pixel Art</h1>
<p>These are some of the pixel art works I’ve made over the years.</p>
<p>Since I was very young, I have been drawing - and have been
fascinated with video game sprites and backgrounds. I naturally spent
quite some time getting better at making pixelart, hanging on PixelJoint
and the Spriters’ Resource forums.</p>
<p>Pretty much all of these were made entirely in mspaint - though I
have been using other tools here and there, like <a href="#">usenti</a>
and <a href="#">gale</a>, and more recently <a
href="#">aseprite</a>.</p>

<h1 id="sketches">Sketches</h1>
<p>Here is a small selection of sketches I have done.</p>
<p>Ever since a very young age, I have always been drawing whenever I
could get my hands on a pencil and some paper. As such, I have drawn
many many sketches over the years - though I have not drawn as much as I
would like, ever since I learned to program, and got a job…</p>
