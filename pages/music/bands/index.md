# Music bands

When I was a teenager, I played in several cover bands (rock throughout middle school, then went towards funk and jazz music going into high school).

---

I then found a group of people who were serious about writing original songs as a band, the genre being a mix of funk, reggae, and jazz.

### Dynam Cross

The band we had was originally called *Dynam Cross*, and we did a couple of small gigs for 2-3 years.

Here is a list of the band members of *Dynam Cross*:

- **Bassist**: *myself*
- **Drums**: Guillaume Rossignol (and later, Alexandre Denis)
- **Guitarist**: Maximilien Girault
- **Keyboards**: Étienne Chassagnol
- **Singer**: Constance Matthiessen
- **Rapper**: Daniel Norbert
- **Saxophone (baritone)**: Pierre Desbrosses
- **Saxophone (tenor)**: Justin Larue
- **Saxophone (alto), Clarinet**: Théophile Fleury

Many thanks to those who saw us play live, back in the day.

Here are the unreleased songs (unfortunately, for many of them the vocal tracks were never recorded, these are marked as "instrumental"...):

Afterwards some time passed, some people left, we found a drummer that was in the same mindset/taste as the rest of us, and so us remaining 4 core guys finally decided to orient our musical style towards more of a jazz fusion style.

To symbolize our change of personnel and direction, we changed the band name to become *Tukana* - this was back in 2016.

### Tukana

Here is the list of band members of *Tukana*:

- **Bassist**: *myself*
- **Drums**: Diego Fernandez Cerda
- **Guitarist**: Maximilien Girault
- **Keyboards**: Étienne Chassagnol
- **Saxophone, Flute**: Tom Salguero

We had written 6 tracks, and got 4 of those recorded - unfortunately, the mixes were never finalized, so they are a little rough on the edges.

Since I am somewhat confident/afraid that these songs will stay forever unknown and unreleased, I am taking the liberty of sharing these 4 tracks here.

This band will probably remain ultra-underground, but at least this page will allow it to not become "lost media".

Again, many thanks to those precious few who saw us play live, back in the day.
