# Music bands

When I was a teenager, I played in several cover bands (rock at first, then went towards funk).

I then found a group of people who were serious about writing original songs as a band, the genre being a mix of funk, reggae, and jazz.

The band was originally called *Dynam Cross*, and we did a couple of small gigs for 2-3 years.

Afterwards, some people left, and the 4 core guys (guitarist; keyboardist; drummer; and myself, the bassist)
decided to orient our music more towards more of a jazz fusion style.

To symbolize our change of personnel and direction, we changed the band name to become *Tukana* - this was back in 2017.

### Tukana

We had written 4 tracks, and got those recorded, but the mixes were never finalized, so they are a little rough.
Since I am somewhat confident/afraid that these songs will stay forever unknown and unreleased (apart from those
precious few who saw us play live), I am taking the liberty of sharing these 4 tracks here.
