<h1 id="music">Music</h1>
<p>Here are all the music projects that I worked on over the years.</p>

<h1 id="parody-music">Parody music</h1>
<p>Here are some not-serious dumb parody songs I made - there are
several approaches to this.</p>

<h1 id="music-covers">Music covers</h1>
<p>Here are some covers I have made, of both famous and not so famous
songs.</p>

<h1 id="original-compositions">Original compositions</h1>
<p>These are some of the songs that I have composed/written/recorded
myself.</p>

<h1 id="music-bands">Music bands</h1>
<p>When I was a teenager, I played in several cover bands (rock at
first, then went towards funk).</p>
<p>I then found a group of people who were serious about writing
original songs as a band, the genre being a mix of funk, reggae, and
jazz.</p>
<p>The band was originally called <em>Dynam Cross</em>, and we did a
couple of small gigs for 2-3 years.</p>
<p>Afterwards, some people left, and the 4 core guys (guitarist;
keyboardist; drummer; and myself, the bassist) decided to orient our
music more towards more of a jazz fusion style.</p>
<p>To symbolize our change of personnel and direction, we changed the
band name to become <em>Tukana</em> - this was back in 2017.</p>
<h3 id="tukana">Tukana</h3>
<p>We had written 4 tracks, and got those recorded, but the mixes were
never finalized, so they are a little rough. Since I am somewhat
confident/afraid that these songs will stay forever unknown and
unreleased (apart from those precious few who saw us play live), I am
taking the liberty of sharing these 4 tracks here.</p>

<h1 id="chiptunes">Chiptunes</h1>
<p>These are the music covers I made as 8-bit chiptunes, using
FamiTracker.</p>
<p>I have been making chiptunes since a pretty young age (14-ish) - I
have always found the practice of making chiptunes to be fascinating,
since you must create your own instruments from scratch, writing your
own volume-over-time curves, etc. Not to mention, the large amount of
crazy and interesting techniques that are possible within chiptune
limitations - to list a few: single-channel chords via arpeggios,
single-channel echo, periodic-noise percussion, multi-pitch N163 waves,
and many more…</p>
