# Chiptunes

These are the music covers I made as 8-bit chiptunes, using FamiTracker.

I have been making chiptunes since a pretty young age (14-ish) - I have always found the practice of making chiptunes to be fascinating, since you must create your own instruments from scratch, writing your own volume-over-time curves, etc. Not to mention, the large amount of crazy and interesting techniques that are possible within chiptune limitations - to list a few: single-channel chords via arpeggios, single-channel echo, periodic-noise percussion, multi-pitch N163 waves, and many more...

### Video Game Music covers

I guess I can mention [this fangame project](/pages/games/fangames/castlevania/index.html) which has a chiptune soundtrack.
The soundtrack was made in collboration with my friend, [Gorsal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNFBAXtNk6Q) - he did the songs from *Rondo of Blood*, while I did the songs from *Symphony of the Night*.

Here's my chiptune cover of *Birth of a God*, from *Final Fantasy VII* (PS1).
This is the song that plays during the \"Bizarro Sephiroth\" phase of the game's final boss.

I made this with FamiTracker (using the Konami VRC6 extension module).

The NES-style mockup image with was custom-made by me, using mspaint.

The song is available for download in the following formats:

Here's my chiptune cover of *I'm a Spy*, from *Sonic Adventure 2* (Dreamcast/Gamecube).
This is the song that plays in the "Security Hall" level in the game., in which you play as Rouge the bat.

I made this with FamiTracker (using the Namco N163 extension module).

I also made the mockup image using mspaint, showing what the level might be look like in a Gameboy-Advance-style 2D Sonic game.
This mockup was done using assets from *Sonic Advance*, *Sonic Advance 3* and *Sonic Battle*.

Here's my chiptune cover of the *Doopliss Battle* theme from *Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door* (Gamecube).

I made this with FamiTracker (using the Konami VRC6 extension module).
I know the bell noise sounds pretty weird, but it is quite tough to make a convincing bell noise with only one square channel available.

I also made the N64-style mockup image using mspaint - the Mario sprite is from the original *Paper Mario*, the Doopliss sprite is a custom edit of the *Paper Mario* duplighost sprite, and the background was simply color-reduced to give the N64 lo-fi aesthetic.

Here's my chiptune cover of the *Boss Battle* theme, from *Final Fantasy IV* (SNES).

I made this with FamiTracker (using the Nintendo MMC5 extension module).

for the mockup the dragon uses 4 colors as well as black (it doesn't make much sense to me, but the sprites in the other NES final fantasy games managed to do that so eh), also i chose to make the characters have 3 colors like regular sprites cause i imagined they would be animated like on the SNES.

Here's my chiptune cover of the *Fortuna* planet music from *Starfox* (SNES).

I made this with FamiTracker (using the Konami VRC6 extension module).

I also made some sprites to illustrate what starfox couldve looked like on the NES
After looking closer i noticed plenty of things on this mockup have too many colors so i made a version more loyal to the nes that you can see here http://i.imgur.com/LXYGMZv.png

Here's my chiptune cover of *Wandering Ghosts*, from *Castlevania - Symphony of the Night* (PS1).
This is the song that plays in the "Colosseum" area in the game.

I made this with FamiTracker (using the Konami VRC6 extension module).

I also made a mockup of the game in NES restrictions to illustrate the video, with the help of Emperor Pixel (who has made quite a few more of these NES-style *Castlevania - Symphony of the Night* mockup images, which you can check out here: [1](https://pixeljoint.com/pixelart/82408.htm), [2](https://pixeljoint.com/pixelart/82689.htm), [3](https://pixeljoint.com/pixelart/82857.htm)) - he made the HUD, the alucard sprite and some of the background tiles, and everything else (most of the background and the enemies) were made by me.

This video (and its success) was the impetus for me to start making a NES-style demake of *Castlevania - Rondo of Blood* and *Castlevania - Symphony of the Night*, you can read more about this project of mine [here](/pages/games/fangames/castlevania/index.html).

Here's my chiptune cover of the *Koloktos/Moldarach Battle* theme from *The Legend of Zelda - Skyward Sword*.

I made this with FamiTracker (using the Konami VRC6 extension module).

I also made a mockup to illustrate the video, portraying the fight against Koloktos as if it were on a Gameboy Color *Zelda* game (*Link's Awakening*, *Oracle of Seasons*, *Oracle of Ages*).
Now, I know it doesnt' make much sense, because the song abides to NES audio limitations whereas the mockup follows GBC graphics limitations - but I believe the folks that really care about this sort of technical detail will forgive me.

Here's my chiptune cover of Kefka's last boss theme, *Dancing Mad pt.4*, from *Final Fantasy VI* (SNES).

I made this with FamiTracker (using the Konami VRC6 extension module).

I also made an NES-style mockup, to illustrate the video (though I am pretty sure some parts of Kefka's sprite here has too many colors, so it wouldn't quite work on an actual NES).
