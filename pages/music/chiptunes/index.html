<h1 id="chiptunes">Chiptunes</h1>
<p>These are the music covers I made as 8-bit chiptunes, using
FamiTracker.</p>
<p>I have been making chiptunes since a pretty young age (14-ish) - I
have always found the practice of making chiptunes to be fascinating,
since you must create your own instruments from scratch, writing your
own volume-over-time curves, etc. Not to mention, the large amount of
crazy and interesting techniques that are possible within chiptune
limitations - to list a few: single-channel chords via arpeggios,
single-channel echo, periodic-noise percussion, multi-pitch N163 waves,
and many more…</p>

<p>Here’s my chiptune cover of <em>Birth of a God</em>, from <em>Final
Fantasy VII</em> (PS1). This is the song that plays during the "Bizarro
Sephiroth" phase of the game’s final boss.</p>
<p>I made this with FamiTracker (using the Konami VRC6 extension
module).</p>
<p>The NES-style mockup image with was custom-made by me, using
mspaint.</p>
<p>The song is available for download in the following formats: - <a

<p>Here’s my chiptune cover of <em>I’m a Spy</em>, from <em>Sonic
Adventure 2</em> (Dreamcast/Gamecube). This is the song that plays in
the “Security Hall” level in the game., in which you play as Rouge the
bat.</p>
<p>I made this with FamiTracker (using the Namco N163 extension
module).</p>
<p>I also made the mockup image using mspaint, showing what the level
might be look like in a Gameboy-Advance-style 2D Sonic game. This mockup
was done using assets from <em>Sonic Advance</em>, <em>Sonic Advance
3</em> and <em>Sonic Battle</em>.</p>

<p>Here’s my chiptune cover of the <em>Doopliss Battle</em> theme from
<em>Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door</em> (Gamecube).</p>
<p>I made this with FamiTracker (using the Konami VRC6 extension
module). I know the bell noise sounds pretty weird, but it is quite
tough to make a convincing bell noise with only one square channel
available.</p>
<p>I also made the N64-style mockup image using mspaint - the Mario
sprite is from the original <em>Paper Mario</em>, the Doopliss sprite is
a custom edit of the <em>Paper Mario</em> duplighost sprite, and the
background was simply color-reduced to give the N64 lo-fi aesthetic.</p>

<p>Here’s my chiptune cover of the <em>Boss Battle</em> theme, from
<em>Final Fantasy IV</em> (SNES).</p>
<p>I made this with FamiTracker (using the Nintendo MMC5 extension
module).</p>
<p>for the mockup the dragon uses 4 colors as well as black (it doesn’t
make much sense to me, but the sprites in the other NES final fantasy
games managed to do that so eh), also i chose to make the characters
have 3 colors like regular sprites cause i imagined they would be
animated like on the SNES.</p>

<p>Here’s my chiptune cover of the <em>Fortuna</em> planet music from
<em>Starfox</em> (SNES).</p>
<p>I made this with FamiTracker (using the Konami VRC6 extension
module).</p>
<p>I also made some sprites to illustrate what starfox couldve looked
like on the NES After looking closer i noticed plenty of things on this
mockup have too many colors so i made a version more loyal to the nes
that you can see here http://i.imgur.com/LXYGMZv.png</p>

<p>Here’s my chiptune cover of <em>Wandering Ghosts</em>, from
<em>Castlevania - Symphony of the Night</em> (PS1). This is the song
that plays in the “Colosseum” area in the game.</p>
<p>I made this with FamiTracker (using the Konami VRC6 extension
module).</p>
<p>I also made a mockup of the game in NES restrictions to illustrate
the video, with the help of Emperor Pixel (who has made quite a few more
of these NES-style <em>Castlevania - Symphony of the Night</em> mockup
images, which you can check out here: <a
href="https://pixeljoint.com/pixelart/82408.htm">1</a> <a
href="https://pixeljoint.com/pixelart/82689.htm">2</a> <a
href="https://pixeljoint.com/pixelart/82857.htm">3</a> ) - he made the
HUD, the alucard sprite and some of the background tiles, and everything
else (most of the background and the enemies) were made by me.</p>
<p>This video (and its success) was the impetus for me to start making a
NES-style demake of <em>Castlevania - Rondo of Blood</em> and
<em>Castlevania - Symphony of the Night</em>, you can read more about
this project of mine <a
href="/games/fangames/castlevania/index.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Here’s my chiptune cover of the <em>Koloktos/Moldarach Battle</em>
theme from <em>The Legend of Zelda - Skyward Sword</em>.</p>
<p>I made this with FamiTracker (using the Konami VRC6 extension
module).</p>
<p>I also made a mockup to illustrate the video, portraying the fight
against Koloktos as if it were on a Gameboy Color <em>Zelda</em> game
(<em>Link’s Awakening</em>, <em>Oracle of Seasons</em>, <em>Oracle of
Ages</em>). Now, I know it doesnt’ make much sense, because the song
abides to NES audio limitations whereas the mockup follows GBC graphics
limitations - but I believe the folks that really care about this sort
of technical detail will forgive me.</p>

<p>Here’s my chiptune cover of Kefka’s last boss theme, <em>Dancing Mad
pt.4</em>, from <em>Final Fantasy VI</em> (SNES).</p>
<p>I made this with FamiTracker (using the Konami VRC6 extension
module).</p>
<p>I also made an NES-style mockup, to illustrate the video (though I am
pretty sure some parts of Kefka’s sprite here has too many colors, so it
wouldn’t quite work on an actual NES).</p>
