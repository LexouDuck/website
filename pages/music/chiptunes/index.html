<h1 id="chiptunes">Chiptunes</h1>
<p>These are the music covers I made as 8-bit chiptunes, using FamiTracker.</p>
<p>I have been making chiptunes since a pretty young age (14-ish) - I have always found the practice of making chiptunes to be fascinating, since you must create your own instruments from scratch, writing your own volume-over-time curves, etc. Not to mention, the large amount of crazy and interesting techniques that are possible within chiptune limitations - to list a few: single-channel chords via arpeggios, single-channel echo, periodic-noise percussion, multi-pitch N163 waves, and many more…</p>

<h3 id="video-game-soundtracks">Video Game soundtracks</h3>
<p>And also, I typically make at least one chiptune song for each GBJam I’ve participated in - here are some of them:</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/gbjam-9">9th GBJAM</a> (in 2021), our entry was named <a href="/pages/games/gamejams/lost_sword_citadel/index.html">Lost Sword Citadel</a>. This song plays after the player has collected all the important orbs, thus opening the door to the witch’s citadel.</p>

<p>I guess I should also mention my <a href="/pages/games/fangames/castlevania/index.html">Castlevania demake fangame project</a> which features an authentic NES chiptune soundtrack. The soundtrack was made in collboration with my friend, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNFBAXtNk6Q">Gorsal</a> - he did the songs from <em>Rondo of Blood</em>, while I did the songs from <em>Symphony of the Night</em>.</p>

<h3 id="video-game-music-covers">Video Game Music covers</h3>
<p>For several years now, I’ve had a hobby of making covers of video game music (and other tunes from real-life bands). Here are theo nes I’ve actually uploaded to my youtube channel and made public.</p>

<p>Here’s my chiptune cover of <em>Birth of a God</em>, from <em>Final Fantasy VII</em> (PS1). This is the song that plays during the "Bizarro Sephiroth" phase of the game’s final boss.</p>
<p>I made this with FamiTracker (using the Konami VRC6 extension module).</p>
<p>The NES-style mockup image with was custom-made by me, using mspaint.</p>
<p>The song is available for download in the following formats: <a href="#">MP3</a>, <a href="#">WAV</a>, <a href="https://www.mediafire.com/file/3s6zl2ohw4zenux/FF+VII+-+Birth+of+a+God.nsf">NSF</a></p>

<p>Here’s my chiptune cover of <em>I’m a Spy</em>, from <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em> (Dreamcast/Gamecube). This is the song that plays in the “Security Hall” level in the game., in which you play as Rouge the bat.</p>
<p>I made this with FamiTracker (using the Namco N163 extension module).</p>
<p>I also made the mockup image using mspaint, showing what the level might be look like in a Gameboy-Advance-style 2D Sonic game. This mockup was done using assets from <em>Sonic Advance</em>, <em>Sonic Advance 3</em> and <em>Sonic Battle</em>.</p>
<p>The song is available for download in the following formats: <a href="#">MP3</a>, <a href="#">WAV</a>, <a href="https://www.mediafire.com/file/which8eme219ixt/Sonic_A2B_-_I%27m_A_Spy.nsf">NSF</a></p>

<p>Here’s my chiptune cover of the <em>Doopliss Battle</em> theme from <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door</em> (Gamecube).</p>
<p>I made this with FamiTracker (using the Konami VRC6 extension module). I know the bell noise sounds pretty weird, but it is quite tough to make a convincing bell noise with only one square channel available.</p>
<p>I also made the N64-style mockup image using mspaint - the Mario sprite is from the original <em>Paper Mario</em>, the Doopliss sprite is a custom edit of the <em>Paper Mario</em> duplighost sprite, and the background was simply color-reduced to give the N64 lo-fi aesthetic.</p>
<p>The song is available for download in the following formats: <a href="#">MP3</a>, <a href="#">WAV</a>, <a href="https://www.mediafire.com/file/2hfuh73fa2tnpa0/Paper_Mario_TTYD_-_Doopliss.nsf">NSF</a></p>

<p>Here’s my chiptune cover of the <em>Boss Battle</em> theme, from <em>Final Fantasy IV</em> (SNES).</p>
<p>I made this with FamiTracker (using the Nintendo MMC5 extension module).</p>
<p>for the mockup the dragon uses 4 colors as well as black (it doesn’t make much sense to me, but the sprites in the other NES final fantasy games managed to do that so eh), also i chose to make the characters have 3 colors like regular sprites cause i imagined they would be animated like on the SNES.</p>
<p>The song is available for download in the following formats: <a href="#">MP3</a>, <a href="#">WAV</a>, <a href="https://www.mediafire.com/file/m81dc7d4icxgdm8/FF_IV_-_Boss_Battle.nsf">NSF</a></p>

<p>Here’s my chiptune cover of the <em>Fortuna</em> planet music from <em>Starfox</em> (SNES).</p>
<p>I made this with FamiTracker (using the Konami VRC6 extension module).</p>
<p>I also made some sprites to illustrate what starfox couldve looked like on the NES After looking closer i noticed plenty of things on this mockup have too many colors so i made a version more loyal to the nes that you can see here http://i.imgur.com/LXYGMZv.png</p>
<p>The song is available for download in the following formats: <a href="#">MP3</a>, <a href="#">WAV</a>, <a href="https://www.mediafire.com/file/jzef1eob8rq4gy0/Starfox_-_Fortuna.nsf">NSF</a></p>

<p>Here’s my chiptune cover of <em>Wandering Ghosts</em>, from <em>Castlevania - Symphony of the Night</em> (PS1). This is the song that plays in the “Colosseum” area in the game.</p>
<p>I made this with FamiTracker (using the Konami VRC6 extension module).</p>
<p>I also made a mockup of the game in NES restrictions to illustrate the video, with the help of Emperor Pixel (who has made quite a few more of these NES-style <em>Castlevania - Symphony of the Night</em> mockup images, which you can check out here: <a href="https://pixeljoint.com/pixelart/82408.htm">1</a>, <a href="https://pixeljoint.com/pixelart/82689.htm">2</a>, <a href="https://pixeljoint.com/pixelart/82857.htm">3</a>) - he made the HUD, the alucard sprite and some of the background tiles, and everything else (most of the background and the enemies) were made by me.</p>
<p>This video (and its success) was the impetus for me to start making a NES-style demake of <em>Castlevania - Rondo of Blood</em> and <em>Castlevania - Symphony of the Night</em>, you can read more about this project of mine <a href="/pages/games/fangames/castlevania/index.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>The song is available for download in the following formats: <a href="#">MP3</a>, <a href="#">WAV</a>, <a href="https://www.mediafire.com/file/j88vh5j64loxh9j/Castlevania_SotN_-_Wandering_Ghosts.nsf">NSF</a></p>

<p>Here’s my chiptune cover of the <em>Koloktos/Moldarach Battle</em> theme from <em>The Legend of Zelda - Skyward Sword</em>.</p>
<p>I made this with FamiTracker (using the Konami VRC6 extension module).</p>
<p>I also made a mockup to illustrate the video, portraying the fight against Koloktos as if it were on a Gameboy Color <em>Zelda</em> game (<em>Link’s Awakening</em>, <em>Oracle of Seasons</em>, <em>Oracle of Ages</em>). Now, I know it doesnt’ make much sense, because the song abides to NES audio limitations whereas the mockup follows GBC graphics limitations - but I believe the folks that really care about this sort of technical detail will forgive me.</p>
<p>The song is available for download in the following formats: <a href="#">MP3</a>, <a href="#">WAV</a>, <a href="https://www.mediafire.com/file/23as2ure0icq99r/Legend_of_Zelda_Skyward_Sword_-_Koloktos_Battle.nsf">NSF</a></p>

<p>Here’s my chiptune cover of Kefka’s last boss theme, <em>Dancing Mad pt.4</em>, from <em>Final Fantasy VI</em> (SNES).</p>
<p>I made this with FamiTracker (using the Konami VRC6 extension module).</p>
<p>I also made an NES-style mockup, to illustrate the video (though I am pretty sure some parts of Kefka’s sprite here has too many colors, so it wouldn’t quite work on an actual NES).</p>
<p>The song is available for download in the following formats: <a href="#">MP3</a>, <a href="#">WAV</a>, <a href="https://www.mediafire.com/file/jb86vmrxvc1ozq6/FF_VI_-_Dancing_Mad.nsf">NSF</a></p>
