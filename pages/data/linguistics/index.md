### Table of language qualifier terms

This table compares ways to qualify/quantify differents kinds fo concepts/objects across multiple languages.

This was originally made to understand [japanese ko-so-a-do words](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese-grammar/kosoado/) in particular, but has grown bigger and more complete over time.

Also note: the first table shown here, [Iqglic](https://www.ostracodfiles.com/iqglic/iqglic.html), is a [conlang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language) meant to be an overly logical simplified version of english.
