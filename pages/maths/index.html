<h1 id="maths">Maths</h1>
<p>Here are some of the projects I worked on, which relate to mathematics.</p>
<hr />
<hr />
<h1 id="mathophilia">Mathophilia</h1>
<p>This is not so much <em>my</em> project as it is my brother’s - the idea is to experiment with better ways to teach math.</p>
<p><a href="/pages/maths/mathophilia/index.html">Read more…</a></p>

<h1 id="table-of-polyhedra">Table of Polyhedra</h1>
<p>This is a simple table to list all of regular (interesting) polyhedra in 3 dimensions.</p>

<hr />
<h1 id="property-table-of-algebraic-structures">Property Table of Algebraic Structures</h1>
<p>This project is, first and foremost, an exercise I did for myself - to better get a grasp of the many terms and concepts of group theory and category theory.</p>
<p>The exercise is quite simple: to fill up some huge spreadsheets, mapping each and every algebraic structure (for example, the natural numbers <code>ℕ</code> with the operator <code>+</code>) to each common property of algebra (for example, “associativity”). The goal is also to have the relevant proofs in each cell as extra annotations.</p>
<p>I have begun to implement all of these proofs using <a href="https://www.lean-lang.org/">lean</a>, with the valuable help of the wonderful <a href="https://www.posthumanart.com/post/joseph-dimos">Joseph Dimos</a>. The end goal is to create a large database of the properties of mathematical structures, such that one may query for any example structure with the desired properties that suit their mathematical needs.</p>

<hr />
<h1 id="base-neutral-number-notation">Base-Neutral Number Notation</h1>
<p>This is a notation system for integers which I invented.</p>
<p>This system is not based on additions of powers of an arbitrary radix, like a traditional number base (decimal being radix=10, hexadecimal is radix=16, binary is radix=2, etc). Instead, this notation system is based on the idea of multiplication, and the concept of prime numbers (which is a natural consequence of multiplication).</p>

<hr />
<h1 id="axioms-and-systems-table">Axioms and Systems table</h1>
<p>To better understand the various systems of set theory (ZF,ZFC,etc) and the axioms they each use, I began to draw up a large mapping of axioms to all major systems of logic.</p>
