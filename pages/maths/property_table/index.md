# Property Table of Algebraic Structures

This project is first and foremost an exercise I did for myself, to better get a grasp of the many terms and concepts of group theory and category theory.

The exercise is quite simple: to fill up some huge spreadsheets, mapping each and every algebraic structure, to each common property of algebra - with the relevant proofs in each cell.

Here are the (as-of-yet quite incomplete) tables in question:

### For binary operators

### For unary operators
