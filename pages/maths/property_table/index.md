# Property Table of Algebraic Structures

This project is, first and foremost, an exercise I did for myself - to better get a grasp of the many terms and concepts of group theory and category theory.

The exercise is quite simple: to fill up some huge spreadsheets, mapping each and every algebraic structure (for example, the natural numbers `â„•` with the operator `+`) to each common property of algebra (for example, "associativity"). The goal is also to have the relevant proofs in each cell as extra annotations.

I have begun to implement all of these proofs using [lean](https://www.lean-lang.org/), with the valuable help of the wonderful [Joseph Dimos](https://www.posthumanart.com/post/joseph-dimos).
The end goal is to create a large database of the properties of mathematical structures, such that one may query for any example structure with the desired properties that suit their mathematical needs.

Here are the (as-of-yet quite incomplete) tables in question:

### For unary operators
