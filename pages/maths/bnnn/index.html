<h1 id="base-neutral-number-notation">Base-Neutral Number Notation</h1>
<p>This is a notation system for integers which I invented.</p>
<p>This system is not based on additions of powers of an arbitrary
radix, like a traditional number base (decimal being radix=10,
hexadecimal is radix=16, binary is radix=2, etc). Instead, this notation
system is based on the idea of multiplication, and the concept of prime
numbers (which is a natural consequence of multiplication).</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="the-why">The “why”</h3>
<p>I think we are lacking a number notation system which can indicate a
number base in a non-ambiguous fashion. Similar to how musicians have a
clef at the beginning of a sheet of music to indicate the point of
reference of the musical staff, I think mathematics can benefit from
using (sparingly!) a base-neutral number notation system - for example,
as a way of indicating the chosen number base.</p>
<p>Too often I have seen people write the name of our common decimal
system as “base 10” - if you think about it, literally every base can be
said to be “base 10” (provided 0 and 1 are the first two characters
chosen to represent this number base). This goes to show how
decimal-centric our point of view is. It is nevertheless true that we
have 10 - I mean, <strong>ten</strong> fingers, after all…</p>
<p>Others have already made great points at how other number bases can
be more effective than decimal: special mention to <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qID2B4MK7Y0">this video, making a
great case for base 6 as a viable number base to use in everyday
life</a>.</p>
<p>But here, the goal is to not rely on some arbitrary integer as the
fundamental basis for our notation of quantities. What else can we use
to construct a number notation system ? The best answer I have come up
with is to use prime numbers, or to be more exact: <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_arithmetic">the
fundamental theorem of arithmetic</a>. Thanks to this truth, we can
simplify the problem: instead of having to design a new glyph for each
and every number, we can design new glyphs only for prime numbers, and
represent all the non-prime (composite) numbers by combining the prime
number glyphs that make up its prime factor decomposition.</p>
<p>So a simple, naive approach here might look like this:</p>

<p>Instead of concatenating prime factors together horizontally like on
the table above, my decision was to have the entire glyph be rotated by
right angle, such that prime factors would be stacked up vertically to
notate a composite number. This way, the width of each of the glyphs
stays similar, though their heights will vary. And, since almost every
human writing system writes horizontally and not vertically, it is
easier to tell apart a character from its adjacent neighbors in this
way.</p>
<p>Here is a spreadsheet of the glyphs I’ve decided to use:</p>
<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRT0n7SD_-wCBRO_Tz_vDCRAipDj_PBGaoDCqkplb4Bt-1EpBTn1gLdObA3QbECBF8b1wfsr5E6oqsr/pubhtml?gid=0&amp;single=true&amp;widget=true&amp;headers=false" style="width:80%;height:80vh;">
</iframe>
<p>It is quite intentional that the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8 look
quite similar to those we know and use daily. After that, the prime
number glyphs follow certain patterns in how their gyphs are
designed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prime glyphs which represent <a href="#">twin primes</a> must be
vertically symmetrical to each other.</li>
<li>Prime glyphs grow more complex respective to the order they appear
in - the higher the prime number the more elaborate the glyph which
represents it.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are some notable exceptional glyphs - these are mostly for
speed and ease-of-writing, as well as to give this number notation
system some visual flair, similar to what a natural language might
enjoy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Square numbers (numbers with a natural integer square root,
i.e. <code>n ∈ ℕ, √n ∈ ℕ</code>) have a special glyph, typically
featuring n-partite symmetry.</li>
<li>Cubic numbers (numbers with a natural integer cube root,
i.e. <code>n ∈ ℕ, ∛n ∈ ℕ</code>)</li>
<li>The number <code>4</code> is the first square number
(<code>2×2</code>), as well as the first composite number, and it
extremely common across the board - so it has a special glyph, borne of
a conjoined concatenation of two <code>2</code>s - and so, its glyph
resembles a mirrored <code>§</code> section symbol.</li>
<li>The number <code>8</code> is the first cubic number
(<code>2×2×2</code>), and so it also enjoys an exceptional glyph. This
special glyph is chosen really just to look like the <code>8</code> we
are all used to.</li>
</ul>
<p>And here is an (as of yet incomplete) multiplication table written in
base-neutral number notation:</p>
<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRT0n7SD_-wCBRO_Tz_vDCRAipDj_PBGaoDCqkplb4Bt-1EpBTn1gLdObA3QbECBF8b1wfsr5E6oqsr/pubhtml?gid=545017230&amp;single=true&amp;widget=true&amp;headers=false" style="width:100%;height:80vh;">
</iframe>
<p>Seeing this table makes it easy to understand the big advantage of
this number system: it makes multiplication so simple as to be nearly
trivial - and it also makes us recall the big disadvantage, which is
that addition is notably less simple in this system than it would be
with common integer bases. This makes intuitive sense, since we based
our notation system on the very idea of multication, since prime numbers
and the fundamental theorem of arithmetic are just the logical
consequence of the notion of multiplication.</p>
<p>So, I do not believe it would be very wise to begin using this
notation system everywhere - but there are a select few areas where it
can have its uses and merits. In particular, one thought that
immediately comes to mind would be to use this to indicate the choice of
a number base at the beginning of a mathematics document, in a totally
unambiguous fashion.</p>
