# Mathophilia

This is not so much *my* project as it is my brother's - the idea is to experiment with better ways to teach math.

---

The first of such experiments is a big document which teaches important notions, symbols and vocabulary of several areas of mathematics, but without any of the proofs - instead just examples, visual geometric intuitions, and explanations.

The first and second versions of this document are available for download in both english and french, from [here](https://github.com/Fulguritude/Mathophilie).

The third version is still being worked on - It will be available as a website, since it makes a lot of sense for mathematical learning to be done via hyperlinks, in a non-linear fashion.
