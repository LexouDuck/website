# Rogue Angels

This is my "brainchild" game, as some might say - in other words, this is the project
that I have kept in the back of my head and kept brainstorming on/off for many many years...

Without revealing too much:

The core idea is to make a roguelike grid-based game, in which each new "run"
will generate a new unique story for the player. How this can be accomplished
is with a complex and innovative algorithmic system that can
generate rich and believable NPC personalities/emotions.

As for the titular "angels", they do not come from any common mythos you might know,
they are instead pure incarnations of various concepts or ideas from mathematics, physics, philosophy, etc.
