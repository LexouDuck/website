### FIGHTING TITANS

This is a game I worked on with a buddy from the Spriters Resource forums,
[Sketchasaurus](https://twitter.com/g33x) (he made most all of the graphics,
and thought out most the gameplay concepts, I did all the programming).
It\'s a sort of fighting game in \"fake 3D\"/\"2.5D\",
built according to NES (Nintendo Entertainment System) console limitations.

I programmed it in [Haxe](https://haxe.org/), using the
[Haxeflixel](https://haxeflixel.com/) library.

The game features 8 playable titan characters, each with different stats, projectile attacks, and special moves.

You can download the game [here]().
