# Fighting Titans

This is a game I worked on with a buddy from the Spriters Resource forums, [Sketchasaurus](https://twitter.com/g33x).
He made pretty much all of the graphics, and thought out most the gameplay concepts.
I did all of the programming, as well as pitching in ideas and designs.
It's a sort of fighting game in \"fake 3D\", or what some call \"2.5D\",
built according to NES (Nintendo Entertainment System) console limitations.

I programmed the game in [Haxe](https://haxe.org/), using the [Haxeflixel](https://haxeflixel.com/) library.

The game features 8 playable "titan" characters, each with different stats, projectile attacks, and special moves.

Here are some of the mockups that Sketchasaurus originally made, which made me want to work on this:

Here are some clips of gameplay from the test builds of the game, as it was being developed:
