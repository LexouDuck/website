<p>These are game projects that I worked on in collaboration with other people.</p>

<h1 id="fighting-titans">Fighting Titans</h1>
<p><strong>STATUS:</strong> ???</p>
<p>This is a 2-person game project I worked on around 2016.</p>
<p>It is a unique combination of genres: fighting game, and beat-em-up. The playable characters are various creatures with special powers, and their battles are set in large arenas for humans to enjoy.</p>

<h1 id="pipe-works">Pipe Works</h1>
<p><strong>STATUS:</strong> Hiatus</p>
<p>This was a project I worked on with the <a href="https://dreamshowadventures.com/">Dream Show Adventures</a> team, around 2013.</p>
<p>It is a puzzle game, in which the player rearranges and rotates pipes around, to meet various level objectives. It was developed primarily for mobile phone platforms.</p>

<h1 id="sharkaiger">Sharkaiger</h1>
<p><strong>STATUS:</strong> Hiatus</p>
<p>This is the first game project I helped out on, all the way back in 2010.</p>
<p>It is a puzzle-platformer game, which can be either co-op or single-player. It features 4 distinct playable shark protagonists, working together despite their differences to escape from (and take down) the soulless MOBY corp.ltd.inc.</p>

<h1 id="drill-bunny">Drill Bunny</h1>
<p><strong>STATUS:</strong> Hiatus</p>
<p>This was a project I worked on with the <a href="https://dreamshowadventures.com/">Dream Show Adventures</a> team, around 2013.</p>
<p>This game was developed primarily for mobile phone platforms, it is a relatively simple “runner”-type game, where the objective is to drill down into the earth as deep as possible, avoiding obstacles, collecting items &amp; powerups, aiming for that <em>high score</em>.</p>
