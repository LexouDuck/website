**STATUS:** Hiatus

This is the first game project I helped out on, all the way back in 2010.

It is a puzzle-platformer game, which can be either co-op or single-player.
It features 4 distinct playable shark protagonists, working together despite
their differences to escape from (and take down) the soulless MOBY corp.ltd.inc.

I learned about it from a thread on The Spriters' Resource, [here](https://www.vg-resource.com/thread-15537.html) is the thread in question.

There was a huge amount of pixelart sprites and animations produced for this game, as well as extensive design documents. Unfortunately, this project occurred before I was capable of programming - the one programmer in the team was extremely busy with his day job (as most programmers tend to be, I know this all too well myself...). There are a couple of playable builds, but they really only are experimental alpha builds, testing out the controls for the playable red & blue sharks.

[Here](https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=15911.0) is the fun in-character devlog that we had going for a short while on the TIGsource forums.

I am still thinking about this - thinking that it's a shame that all these neat assets and animations are just collecting dust on my hard-drive...
