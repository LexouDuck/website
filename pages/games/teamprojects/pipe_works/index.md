# Pipe Works

**STATUS:** Hiatus

This was a project I worked on with the [Dream Show Adventures](#) team, around 2013.

It is a puzzle game, in which the player rearranges and rotates pipes around,
to meet various level objectives. It was developed primarily for mobile phone platforms.

This is a game project from \~2013 that was spearheaded by *ninspriter* (a.k.a. Andrew Agulto).
Early development was documented in forum threads, as a sort of interactive devlog
(ah, the good old days internet forums... in fact, this is how I originally found out about the project).

The extent of my participation was to just implement some menus & buttons.
