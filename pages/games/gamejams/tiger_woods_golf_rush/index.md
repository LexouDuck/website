# Tiger Woods Golf Tour

![](thumbnail.png)

This was a pretty silly game made with a couple of buddies for 41st ludum dare gamejam.

It is a simple puzzle-platformer game, where you play as a large muscular tiger wielding
a golf club. The goal is to send the white golf ball into the goalpost - though the terrain
is very treacherous. To work against the terrain, the titular tiger can place (and golf)
bombs, which explode and destroy/alter the terrain.
