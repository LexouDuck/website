# Swap-em-up: Jutsu

![](thumbnail.png)

**STATUS:** Unfinished

This game was done with my brother and a couple of buddies from the [42 school](https://42.fr/en/homepage/),
for the [*GTMK 2018 gamejam*](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2018).

The theme of the gamejam was "*GENRE* game, but you can't *MECHANIC*".
For this game, that would be beat-em-up/twin-stick shooter, but without being able to shoot/hit enemies.
Instead, the player character has a swap ability, which allows him to switch places with
enemy bullets. The player must thus redirect bullets appropriately towards enemies.
