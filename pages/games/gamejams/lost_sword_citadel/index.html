<p><strong>STATUS:</strong> Done, but has bugs and would like to revisit</p>
<p>This game was made for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/gbjam-9">9th GBJAM</a> (Gameboy-themed gamejam), with a group of buddies I knew from my old forum-going days. We managed to get 8th place overall, with <strong>1st place</strong> in graphics !</p>
<p>The game is a top-down adventure game, with combat based on elementally-infused projectiles.</p>
<hr />
<p>The gamejam lasted one week - I programmed most of it, using Unity (I also made a couple of sprites, and one of the chiptunes). I hadn’t ever used Unity before so this was an opportunity to learn on the spot (I already had extensive experience using C#, though).</p>
<p>These online pals of mine made most all of the pixelart, and music - I made one track, and a couple of sprites. To be more precise, we called the team <a href="https://gallowaygames.itch.io">Galloway Games</a>, in reference to an old forum we had going long ago.</p>
<p>You can play the game directly in your browser (or download the executable), over on the <a href="https://gallowaygames.itch.io/lost-sword-citadel">official page on itch.io</a></p>
<p>Here are some screenshots of the game:</p>
<p><img src="screenshot-1.png" /> <img src="screenshot-2.png" /> <img src="screenshot-3.jpg" /> <img src="screenshot-4.png" /></p>
<p>And here are some GIFs roughly showing how it plays:</p>
<p><img src="gameplay-1.gif" /> <img src="gameplay-2.gif" /> <img src="gameplay-3.gif" /></p>
<p>The main gameplay gimmick is that the A button shoots projectiles, and B button locks the player’s facing direction, which allows strafing. The game has 3 orbs that the player must collect, each granting him a new elemental projectile-modifying ability. These elemental effects vary as to what they do (ice slows down, fire deals plenty of damage, and lightning deals moderate damage, while periodically stunning) - these effects also spread around to nearby enemies (and to the player!).</p>
<p>After the gamejam, I spent a little while fixing several glaring issues with the game’s engine, though I must admit it is quite a challenge to get a nice, stable “fake 3D” engine in Unity (mostly due to how Unity handles collisions).</p>
<p>If I were to get back to working on this, the main idea I wanted to implement was to make the key equippable items alter how the B button works. You would start with nothing on the B button, then quickly learn the “facing-lock”. Afterwards, you could have the ability to run, to jump, to carry objects. If this idea sounds very much like a classic Zelda game, then I can only say “guilty”…</p>
