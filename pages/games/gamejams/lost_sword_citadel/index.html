<h1 id="lost-sword-citadel-gamejam">Lost Sword Citadel (gamejam)</h1>
<p>This game was made for the 9th GBJAM (Gameboy-themed gamejam), with a
group of buddies I knew from my old forum-going days. The gamejam lasted
one week - I programmed most of it, using Unity. I hadn’t ever used
Unity before so this was an opportunity to learn on the spot (I already
had extensive experience using C#, though).</p>
<p>You can play the game directly in your browser, over on the <a
href="https://gallowaygames.itch.io/lost-sword-citadel">official page on
itch.io</a></p>
<p>Here are some screenshots of the game:</p>

<p>And here are some GIFs roughly showing how it plays:</p>
<p><img src="gameplay-1.gif" /> <img src="gameplay-2.gif" /> <img

<p>The main gameplay gimmick is that the A button shoots projectiles,
and B button locks the player’s facing direction, which allows strafing.
The game has 3 orbs that the player must collect, each granting him a
new elemental projectile-modifying ability. These elemental effects vary
as to what they do (ice slows down, fire deals plenty of damage, and
lightning deals moderate damage, while periodically stunning) - these
effects also spread around to nearby enemies (and to the player!).</p>
<p>After the gamejam, I spent a little while fixing several glaring
issues with the game’s engine, though I must admit it is quite a
challenge to get a nice, stable “fake 3D” engine in Unity (mostly due to
how Unity handles collisions).</p>
<p>If I were to get back to working on this, the main idea I wanted to
implement was to make the key equippable items alter how the B button
works. You would start with nothing on the B button, then quickly learn
the “facing-lock”. Afterwards, you could have the ability to run, to
jump, to carry objects. If this idea sounds very much like a classic
Zelda game, then I can only say “guilty”</p>
