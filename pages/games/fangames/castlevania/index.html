<h1 id="castlevania-symphony-of-blood">Castlevania: Symphony of
Blood</h1>
<p>This is the first game project I ever worked on.<br />
It started as the project for my end-of-highschool exam, since<br />
I was lucky enough to be in a school where, in my last year of
highschool,<br />
I was given the option to select an (experimental) programming
class.</p>
<p>I started working on the project in the middle of the school year
(long before the exam)<br />
because it was of personal interest to me, I always wanted to make
games.<br />
It was more of a hobby to me, especially since I did everything by
myself:<br />
- the graphics (I had been using <a href="#">mspaint</a> from a young
age)<br />
- the music (I learned how to use <a href="#">Famitracker</a> to create
NES-accurate chiptunes)<br />
- the coding (programmed in <a href="#">Python</a> - which was taught in
the class - using the <a href="#">Pygame</a> library)</p>
<p>I chose to “demake” a game I am fond of, which I think is quite
underrated: <em>Castlevania - Rondo of Blood</em>.<br />
This game is not very well-known because it was released on a console
that few people own (or even know),<br />
the <em>PC-Engine</em> - also known as the <em>Turbografx16</em> in
North America -<br />
and also, this game was only ever released in Japan.<br />
Although, the <em>Castlevania</em> series is a well-known franchise, and
there was a game that<br />
loosely resembled this one, that was released in the west:
<em>Castlevania - Dracula X</em>.<br />
Unfortunately <em>Castlevania - Dracula X</em> is very different from
<em>Castlevania - Rondo of Blood</em>,<br />
and most people who have played both generally agree that it is by far
the lesser of the two games.</p>
<p>The idea was to “demake” the game (<em>i.e.</em> to remake it under
lower specs),<br />
in other words, to re-imagine the game, as if it had been released<br />
a few years earlier, on the NES (Nintendo Entertainment System).<br />
During the lifespan of the NES console, <em>Castlevania</em> was one of
the truly big names,<br />
alongside classics like <em>Super Mario</em>, <em>Legend of Zelda</em>,
<em>Metroid</em>, <em>Mega Man</em>, etc.<br />
This would have perhaps allowed the game to enjoy greater accessibility,
and so, greater success.<br />
Demaking the game implies that I had to comply with the technical
limitations of this console.<br />
The NES is not a very powerful system, it has many limitations, in terms
of power, video, audio, etc.</p>
<p>Here are some mockups I made at the very start, to have an idea of
what it might look like:</p>
<div id="screenshot">
<p><img src="mockup-1.png" class="screencap" width="256"
height="224" /><br />
<img src="mockup-2.png" class="screencap" width="256"
height="224" /><br />
<img src="mockup-3.png" class="screencap" width="256"
height="224" /></p>
</div>
<p>Originally, for the high school exam, I just implemented the battle
against the first boss<br />
(or, to be more precise, one of the two “first bosses”, since this game
features branching paths).<br />
I figured that this “lake serpent” enemy would be easier to implement,
since it required little<br />
pixelart sprite work, just a couple of small distinct parts of its body
- and in fact,<br />
making the body parts follow the head of the snake was a fun programming
challenge in and of itself.</p>
<div id="screenshot">
<p><img src="mockup-4.gif" class="screencap" width="256"
height="224" /></p>
</div>
<p>Of course, this first game engine I had built had several bugs
(including some that made the boss trivial),<br />
the player character was clunky to control, and many other issues
regarding Python made me abandon it.</p>
<p>Several years later, after working on several game projects here and
there, and after learning several<br />
other programming languages, I decided to restart, and hopefully finish
this project.</p>
<p>I had two options as to how to develop the game, either: make a
custom engine that can imitate the NES well,<br />
or develop an actual NES ROM in 6502 assembly. Needless to say, being
experienced with C at this point,<br />
and having built a complex fully-featured ROM-hacking tool, <a
href="/tools/emblem_magic/index.html">Emblem Magic</a>,<br />
I had had my fair share of assembly languages, and so I chose the first
option.<br />
What made sense was to create this custom engine in C, using <a
href="#">SDL2</a> - this might sound weird, but<br />
it will make more sense if you know how I view the C language, which I
talk about more <a href="/tools/ccc/index.md">here</a>.</p>
<p>I made progress, and as I did so, so too did the scope of the project
increase.<br />
I not only wanted to pay tribute to <em>Castlevania - Rondo of
Blood</em>, but also to another favorite of mine,<br />
and the favorite of most players out there: <em>Castlevania - Symphony
of the Night</em>.<br />
Now, <em>Symphony of the Night</em> is quite a different game from
<em>Rondo of Blood</em>,<br />
it is not a tough, linear, level-by-level platformer like the original
<em>Castlevania</em> games.<br />
Its “<a href="#">metroidvania</a>” nature makes it much easier to
sidestep or avoid challenging sections,<br />
whereas in <em>Rondo of Blood</em>, there is no easy way out (unless you
play as Maria, that is…).<br />
It seemed to me like there was definitely some just middle of difficulty
and design between the two,<br />
a game where the RPG stat mechanics can help a struggling stuck player
(either through simple grinding,<br />
or some other strategy), but where there is still sufficient challenge
for the player… dare I say, a souls-like ?</p>
<p>It also made a great deal of sense to me to mesh the two games
together, simply because in terms of lore,<br />
<em>Symphony of the Night</em> is a direct sequel to <em>Rondo of
Blood</em>, occuring just a couple of years later,<br />
and featuring many of the same characters. Furthermore, the maps of the
two games have perfect overlap in many areas.</p>
