# bmp2nam

This is a simple commandline tool to process images, and reduce their color-count, such that
the resulting color-reduced image fits within a certain tile-based set of constraints.

In pretty much every old game console, background are drawn using tile-based graphics.
This is a tool that can take in any bitmap image, and spit out a color-reduced version which is tiled-graphics compatible.
