This project is one of 3 parts that make up the ++C language: this is the build system.

The goal is to have a modern package manager tool, made up entirely of shell/makefile scripts.
This means that unlike tools such as [npm](#) or [cargo](#), the dev here can quite easily
go ahead and customize the behavior of his build system.
