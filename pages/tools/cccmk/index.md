# cccmk

This project is one of 3 parts that make up the ++C language: this is the build system.

The goal is to have a modern package manager tool, made up entirely of shell/makefile scripts.
This means that unlike tools such as [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (for the JavaScript ecosystem)
or [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) (for the Rust ecosystem), when using cccmk's `mkfile`,
the dev here can quite easily go ahead and customize the behavior of his build system.
